# The Reddit Timer App 

This is an ongoing project for <a href="https://profy.dev/"> Profy Dev</a>, an organization that helps Junior Developers gain hands-on experience with professional workflows in a team environment. By working on a real project, Developers learn to use GIT in a team environment, write automated tests, use project management tools, and implement pixel-perfect designs.

## Overview
The Reddit Timer App aims to help Content Creators to know the right time to share their content on Reddit so they can reach more people. 

## How I`m working on this project

- I`m building this app based on Figma designs: <br />

- I`m using feature branches and Pull Requests

## How to navigate this project 

- Responsive CSS using styled-components:  <br />

- Integration tests using React Testing Library: <a href="https://github.com/JimeBlue/reddit-timer-JimeBlue/blob/b96abd04fe8a5d53d709b4b9906ab913b8ce806b/src/App.test.js#L10-L22"> example test </a>

## Why I`m building the project this way 
- styled-components is a great library for styling. It includes an auto-prefixer, uses scoped classes, and allows a seamless integration with JS. 
- Testing is an essential part of production applications. Testing Library is the go-to library in the React community. I will cover the essential features of the app with tests.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
